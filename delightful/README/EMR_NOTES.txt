The numbers used for the height/weight/BMI/OFC percentiles are based on the 
World Health Organization's (WHO) growth charts for children.

The tabular data was retreived from the WHO web site in August of 2010.

Note that OFC stands for Occipitofrontal Circumference (head circumference). Lengths 
are in centimeters, and weights are in kilograms. Please note that different charts
apply to boys and girls.

Since different tables use different granularities for age, all the ages were converted 
to days, using the constant 1 months = 30.4368499 day.
